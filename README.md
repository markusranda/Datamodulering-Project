# Datamodulering-Project

Description
-
This is a school project where we created a fictitious library with it's own application made to solve
different tasks needed by the library. This system consists of a database and a java application. 

The main features of the application (can also be seen in the images below):
 - A very simple login system.
 - A detailed loans page where the user sees exactly what he has loaned, when it's due and what the calculated fine is.
 - A "store" where the user can browse all the available books in the different branches of this library, and borrow
 the books the user would like.
 - An inventory page where admins can manage all the content of the library system, including books, branches , etc. It also
 includes the possibility for an admin to add new content to the library system.
